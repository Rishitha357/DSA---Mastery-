121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given
stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one
stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.
If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6),
profit = 6 - 1 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0

No profit can be achieved, so return 0.
